<h2><a name="What is Crochet?"> What is Crochet? </a></h2>

<p><i>Crochet is a type of needlecraft which involves the use of a hooked needle to create fabric from loops of yarn or threads. It is similar to knitting.

<h2><a name="History and Origin of Crochet">History and Origin of Crochet</a></h2>
<p>Much like knitting, the history of crochet is shrouded in mystery and remains largely undocumented. Historians do not know who thecreator of crochet is or the exact place where it originated. What we consider to be crochet today can be traced back to the 15th-17th century. Many Cultures have claimed their crochet  history including: Italy, Arabia, and Chuna. But the true homeland of crochet remains unknown. </i></p>
<br>
<p><i>Crochet came from the French word Croc/Croche which means hook. It also could be connected to the Norse word krokr, which also means hook.</i></p>

<h2><a name="Materials and Tools"> Materials and Tools </a></h2>

<p><i>Crocheting can require various types of tools and equipment that can improve the quality of our work. As a beginner we will only focus on the most essential basic crochet materials which consist of the Yarn, Crochet hooks, Scissors, Tapestry needle, and Stitch Markers.</i></p>
<br>
<h3>1. Yarn </h3>

<p><i>Helps to weave the loose ends. A tapestry needle is a blunt needle with a large eye. The largeeye is useful to needleworkers because it can accommodate threads or fibres that are thicker than ordinary sewing thread. Most tapestry needles are large enough to accommodate crochet thread or embroidery floss, and many are large enough to accommodate yarn as well.</i></p>
